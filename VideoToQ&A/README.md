Take image of those "key wordings" that occur in the video whenever u want the ss to be taken such as occurence of "Explanation" | "Correct Answer:", 
which is followed by the answer. And paste it into main directory
### Part 2
  Make the directory changes in the main.py code (by adding tesseract exe file path and other stuff)
